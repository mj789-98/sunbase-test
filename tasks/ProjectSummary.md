# Sunbase Unity Technical Test - Project Summary

## Project Overview
The project consists of two main tasks demonstrating core Unity and C# development skills:
1. Client Data Display System - A UI-focused system that fetches and displays client data from an API
2. Circle Interaction Game - A simple 2D game with drawing mechanics and collision detection

## Implementation Details

### Client Data Display System
- **Data Models**:
  - Created proper serializable data models for client information including name, points, manager status, and address details
  - Implemented wrapper classes for API responses

- **API Integration**:
  - Implemented a service for fetching data from the endpoint
  - Added robust error handling with retry mechanism
  - Used event-based communication for decoupling components

- **UI Components**:
  - Designed responsive client list UI with selection highlight
  - Implemented filter dropdown with "All Clients", "Managers Only", and "Non-Managers" options
  - Created animated client details popup with clean visual design
  - Added smooth animations for all interactions using DOTween

### Circle Interaction Game
- **Circle Generation**:
  - Implemented random circle spawning with proper spacing
  - Ensured circles are fully visible within screen bounds
  - Added visual feedback for circle interactions

- **Line Drawing**:
  - Created a line renderer-based system for drawing curved lines
  - Implemented precise cursor following with proper vertex distance control
  - Added visual feedback while drawing

- **Collision Detection**:
  - Implemented efficient collision detection between drawn lines and circles
  - Created intersection testing algorithm for line segments and circles
  - Added visual feedback for successful hits

- **Game Management**:
  - Added restart functionality and score tracking
  - Implemented proper game state management
  - Created smooth transitions and animations for game events

## Architecture Highlights
- **SOLID Principles**:
  - Single Responsibility: Each class has a single, well-defined responsibility
  - Open/Closed: Components designed for extension without modification
  - Liskov Substitution: Proper inheritance hierarchies where used
  - Interface Segregation: Clean interfaces with focused responsibilities
  - Dependency Inversion: Components depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations

- **Project Organization**:
  - Proper separation of concerns between UI, data, and logic
  - Modular design with reusable components
  - Clean component-based architecture following Unity best practices
  - Event-driven communication between components

- **Performance Considerations**:
  - Efficient collision detection algorithms
  - Object pooling for frequently used elements
  - Optimized animations for smooth performance
  - Careful resource management

## Conclusion
The project successfully implements all requirements specified in the PRD. The architecture follows best practices for Unity development, resulting in a clean, maintainable codebase with proper separation of concerns and component-based design. All animations are smooth and responsive, and both tasks demonstrate proper integration of UI, data, and game mechanics.
